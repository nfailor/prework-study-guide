# <"Prework Study Guide Webpage">

## Description

The following README file pertains to a webpage created to more easily study and understand the coding bootcamp pre-work material, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Allowing for one central location to not only place notes, but also see the product in action is a great learning experience, and something to easily call back on when needed. The project taught me the basic fundamentals of front-end coding in a way that was simple to understand and allows for a good foundation for learning in the future.
