        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Tag is represented by angle brackets with associated tage names contained inside, designed to place elements on the page</li>
          <li>Element is content in between tags like text, an image, etc. This comment is an element in between a tag.</li>
          <li>br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>declarations - contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration “color: blue;” includes the CSS property “color” and the value for that property, “blue.”</li>
          <li>margin - acts much like a margin in a word processing document, indicates how much space we want around the OUTSIDE of an element. Margin not visible on the page; merely adds a buffer. When margin is set to “0” we are indicating we want NO space around the element</li>
          <li>padding - adds space around the content INSIDE an element. When you increase padding, you are making the entire element bigger. Padding is located inside the element, whereas margin is outside an element.</li>
          <li>IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT EVERY HTML ELEMENT IS ESSENTIALLY A BOX, CONSISTING OF MARGINS OUTSIDE THE ELEMENT, AND THE ELEMENT'S BORDERS, PADDING, AND CONTENT, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS THE CSS BOX MODEL</li>
          <li>* - declaring all elements of the page will have the same style properties</li>

          <li>pwd: print working directory - displays the current working directory in the terminal</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>Variable: different data types of coding languages, as seen below</li>
          <li>String: sequence of text enclosed in single or double quote marks</li>
          <li>Number: number with no quotes around them. Just a regular number</li>
          <li>Boolean: true/false value</li>
          <li>Array: structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference</li>
          <li>Object: can be anything. Everything in JS can be an object and can be stored in a variable</li>
          <li>Addition (+): add two numbers or combine two strings</li>
          <li>Subtraction, multiplication, division (-, *, /) - what you'd expect in basic math</li>
          <li>Assignment (=): assigns a value to a variable</li>
          <li>Strict equality (===): performs a test to see if two values are equal and of the same data type. Returns as a boolean</li>
          <li>      For example: let myVariable = 3; myVariable === 4;</li>
          <li>Not, Does-Not-Equal (!, !==): returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. Turns a true into a false, etc. when it is used alongside the equality operator (see above one), the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal</li>
          <li>      For “not” the basic expression is “true,” but the comparison returns “false,” because we negate it: let myVariable = 3; !(myVariable === 3);</li>
          <li>      “Does-not-equal” gives basically the same result with different syntax. Here we are testing “is myVariable NOT equal to 3.” This returns “false” because myVariable IS equal to 3: let myVariable = 3; myVariable !== 3;</li>
          <li>Note that each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon</li>
