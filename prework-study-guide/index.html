        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Tag is represented by angle brackets with associated tage names contained inside, designed to place elements on the page</li>
          <li>Element is content in between tags like text, an image, etc. This comment is an element in between a tag.</li>
          <li>br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>declarations - contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration “color: blue;” includes the CSS property “color” and the value for that property, “blue.”</li>
          <li>margin - acts much like a margin in a word processing document, indicates how much space we want around the OUTSIDE of an element. Margin not visible on the page; merely adds a buffer. When margin is set to “0” we are indicating we want NO space around the element</li>
          <li>padding - adds space around the content INSIDE an element. When you increase padding, you are making the entire element bigger. Padding is located inside the element, whereas margin is outside an element.</li>
          <li>IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT EVERY HTML ELEMENT IS ESSENTIALLY A BOX, CONSISTING OF MARGINS OUTSIDE THE ELEMENT, AND THE ELEMENT'S BORDERS, PADDING, AND CONTENT, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS THE CSS BOX MODEL</li>
          <li>* - declaring all elements of the page will have the same style properties</li>
